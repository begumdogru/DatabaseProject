airport_id,airport_city,airport_name

airport_id -> airport_city,airport_name
airport_city -> airport_name


Since all attributes are in atomic form it is 1NF.
Data does not require more than one column to qualify as a unique identifier.
Thus, it is in 2NF


Canonical Form of the table:
Step 1: Obtain singleton RHS
	flight_id   ->    plane_id   
	flight_id   ->    flight_date   
	flight_id   ->    flight_time   
	flight_id   ->    destination   
	flight_date ->    flight_time   
Step2: Remove extraneous attributes
	Since left side is singleton,it can't contain any extraneous attribute.
Step3: Remove reduntans FDs
	flight_id   ->    plane_id   
	flight_id   ->    flight_date   
	flight_id   ->    destination   
	flight_date ->    flight_time 
Step4: Final merged minimal cover:
	flight        ->    plane_id, flight_date, destination
	flight_date   ->    flight_time 


BCNF:

(flight)+ = (flight_id, plane_id, flight_date, destination) 

(flight_date)+ =(flight_date, flight_time) -> it violates the BCNF. because flight_date is
neither a super key nor a superset thereof.

 identifier = {flight_date}

Decomposition:
	R1=(flight_date, flight_time)
	R2=(flight_id,flight_date,plane_id,destination)
